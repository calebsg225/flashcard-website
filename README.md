# Flashcard Website

This React.js site allows users to create custom flashcard sets they can then study. The cards are shuffled each time the user goes to study a set.

## What I Learned

I learned how important planning is when creating a site like this. I made the mistake of trying to wing the localStorage system and ended up restructuring things many times before I landed on the current iteration.
